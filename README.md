Hello. This is code for a project created for a contractor acquaintance. This project is intended to be used by the contractor in the future as a 
portfolio/booking website. The website mainly uses React for its backend framework. This website contains a navigation bar, an "about me" section, 
a field of experience section showcasing the mutliple trades that the contractor is experienced in, a projects section containing pictures and 
descriptions of previous residential jobs that the contractor has done, and an email service allowing any potential client to email the contractor
in order to arrange a consultation. As far as the email service goes, I plan to make a calendar-like function on the actual website that then sends
an alert to the contractor for booking. In the best case, the calendar will be able to be accessed differently on his side using a log-in so that 
he can check the booked consultations. As far as the website goes, the design has not been completed, as I am waiting on the contractor to fully
explain his specifications for the design and information presented, as well as the go-ahead for some of my ideas to be implemented. I will continue 
to upload any progress on this project. Thank you for reading.
